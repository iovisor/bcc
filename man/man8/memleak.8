.TH memleak 8  "2016-01-14" "USER COMMANDS"
.SH NAME
memleak \- Print a summary of outstanding allocations and their call stacks to detect memory leaks. Uses Linux eBPF/bcc.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B memleak [-h] [-p PID] [-t] [-a] [-o OLDER] [-c COMMAND] [-s SAMPLE_RATE] [-d STACK_DEPTH] [INTERVAL] [COUNT]
.SH DESCRIPTION
memleak traces and matches memory allocation and deallocation requests, and
collects call stacks for each allocation. memleak can then print a summary
of which call stacks performed allocations that weren't subsequently freed.

When tracing a specific process, memleak instruments malloc and free from libc.
When tracing all processes, memleak instruments kmalloc and kfree.

The stack depth is limited to 10 by default (+1 for the current instruction pointer),
but it can be controlled using the \-d switch if deeper stacks are required.

This currently only works on x86_64. Check for future versions.
.SH REQUIREMENTS
CONFIG_BPF and bcc.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\-h
Print usage message.
.TP
\-p PID
Trace this process ID only (filtered in-kernel). This traces malloc and free from libc.
.TP
\-t
Print a trace of all allocation and free requests and results.
.TP
\-a
Print a list of allocations that weren't freed (and their sizes) in addition to their call stacks.
.TP
\-o OLDER
Print only allocations older than OLDER milliseconds. Useful to remove false positives.
The default value is 500 milliseconds.
.TP
\-c COMMAND
Run the specified command and trace its allocations only. This traces malloc and free from libc.
.TP
\-s SAMPLE_RATE
Record roughly every SAMPLE_RATE-th allocation to reduce overhead.
.TP
\-d STACK_DEPTH
Capture STACK_DEPTH frames (or less) when obtaining allocation call stacks.
The default value is 10.
.TP
INTERVAL
Print a summary of oustanding allocations and their call stacks every INTERVAL seconds.
The default interval is 5 seconds.
.TP
COUNT
Print the outstanding allocations summary COUNT times and then exit.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Print outstanding kernel allocation stacks every 3 seconds:
#
.B memleak 3
.TP
Print user outstanding allocation stacks and allocation details for the process 1005:
#
.B memleak -p 1005 -a
.TP
Run ./allocs and print outstanding allocation stacks for that process: 
#
.B memleak -c "./allocs"
.SH OVERHEAD
memleak can have significant overhead if the target process or kernel performs
allocations at a very high rate. Pathological cases may exhibit up to 100x
degradation in running time. Most of the time, however, memleak shouldn't cause
a significant slowdown. You can also use the \-s switch to reduce the overhead
further by capturing only every N-th allocation.

To determine the rate at which your application is calling malloc/free, or the
rate at which your kernel is calling kmalloc/kfree, place a probe with perf and
collect statistics. For example, to determine how many calls to __kmalloc are
placed in a typical period of 10 seconds:

#
.B perf probe '__kmalloc'

#
.B perf stat -a -e 'probe:__kmalloc' -- sleep 10

Another setting that may help reduce overhead is lowering the number of stack
frames captured and parsed by memleak for each allocation, using the \-d switch.
