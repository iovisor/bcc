.TH funccount 8  "2015-08-18" "USER COMMANDS"
.SH NAME
funccount \- Count kernel function calls matching a pattern. Uses Linux eBPF/bcc.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B funccount [\-h] [\-p PID] [\-i INTERVAL] [\-T] [\-r] pattern
.SH DESCRIPTION
This tool is a quick way to determine which kernel functions are being called,
and at what rate. It uses in-kernel eBPF maps to count function calls.

WARNING: This uses dynamic tracing of (what can be many) kernel functions, an
activity that has had issues on some kernel versions (risk of panics or
freezes). Test, and know what you are doing, before use.

Since this uses BPF, only the root user can use this tool.
.SH REQUIREMENTS
CONFIG_BPF and bcc.
.SH OPTIONS
pattern
Search pattern. Supports "*" wildcards. See EXAMPLES. You can also use \-r for regular expressions.
.TP
\-h
Print usage message.
.TP
\-p PID
Trace this process ID only.
.TP
\-i INTERVAL
Print output every interval seconds.
.TP
\-T
Include timestamps on output.
.TP
\-r
Use regular expressions for the search pattern.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Count kernel functions beginning with "vfs_", until Ctrl-C is hit:
#
.B funccount 'vfs_*'
.TP
Count kernel functions beginning with "tcp_send", until Ctrl-C is hit:
#
.B funccount 'tcp_send*'
.TP
Print kernel functions beginning with "vfs_", every second:
#
.B funccount \-i 1 'vfs_*'
.TP
Match kernel functions beginning with "vfs_", using regular expressions:
#
.B funccount \-r '^vfs_.*'
.TP
Count vfs calls for process ID 181 only:
#
.B funccount \-p 181 'vfs_*'
.SH FIELDS
.TP
ADDR
Address of the instruction pointer that was traced (only useful if the FUNC column is suspicious and you would like to double check the translation).
.TP
FUNC
Kernel function name
.TP
COUNT
Number of calls while tracing
.SH OVERHEAD
This traces kernel functions and maintains in-kernel counts, which
are asynchronously copied to user-space. While the rate of kernel calls
be very high (>1M/sec), this is a relatively efficient way to trace these
events, and so the overhead is expected to be small for normal workloads.
Measure in a test environment before use.
