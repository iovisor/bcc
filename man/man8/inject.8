.SH NAME
inject \- injects appropriate error into function if input call chain and
predicates are satisfied. Uses Linux eBPF/bcc.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B inject -h [-I header] [-P probability] [-v] [-C count] mode spec
.SH DESCRIPTION
inject injects errors into specified kernel functionality when a given call
chain and associated predicates are satsified.

WARNING: This tool injects failures into key kernel functions and may crash the
kernel. You should know what you're doing if you're using this tool.

This makes use of a Linux 4.16 feature (bpf_override_return())

Since this uses BPF, only the root user can use this tool.
