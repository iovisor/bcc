.SH NAME
inject \- injects appropriate error into function if input call chain and
predicates are satisfied. Uses Linux eBPF/bcc.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B trace -h [-I header] [-v]
.SH DESCRIPTION
inject injects errors into specified kernel functionality when a given call
chain and associated predicates are satsified.

This makes use of a Linux 4.16 feature (bpf_override_return())

Additionally, use of the kmalloc failure mode is only possible with 

	commit f7174d08a5fc ("mm: make should_failslab always available for
	fault injection")

which is in mm-tree but not yet in mainline (as of 4.16-rc5).

Since this uses BPF, only the root user can use this tool.
