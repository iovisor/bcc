.TH sslsniff 8  "2016-08-16" "USER COMMANDS"
.SH NAME
sslsniff \- Print data passed to OpenSSL, GnuTLS or NSS. Uses Linux eBPF/bcc.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sslsniff [-h] [-p PID] [-c COMM] [-o] [-g] [-n] [-d] [--hexdump]
.SH DESCRIPTION
sslsniff prints data sent to write/send and read/recv functions of
OpenSSL, GnuTLS and NSS, allowing us to read plain text content before
encryption (when writing) and after decryption (when reading).

This works reading the second parameter of both functions (*buf).

Since this uses BPF, only the root user can use this tool.
.SH REQUIREMENTS
CONFIG_BPF and bcc.
