.TH sslsniff 8  "2016-08-16" "USER COMMANDS"
.SH NAME
sslsniff \- Print data passed to OpenSSL. Uses Linux eBPF/bcc.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sslsniff
.SH DESCRIPTION
sslsniff prints data sent to SSL_write and SSL_read OpenSSL functions, allowing
us to read plain text content before encryption (when writing) and after
decryption (when reading).

This works reading the second parameter of both functions (*buf).

Since this uses BPF, only the root user can use this tool.
