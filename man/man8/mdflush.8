.TH mdflush 8  "2016-02-13" "USER COMMANDS"
.SH NAME
mdflush \- Trace md flush events. Uses Linux eBPF/bcc.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mdflush
.SH DESCRIPTION
This tool traces flush events by md, the Linux multiple device driver
(software RAID). The timestamp and md device for the flush are printed.
Knowing when these flushes happen can be useful for correlation with
unexplained spikes in disk latency.

This works by tracing the kernel md_flush_request() function using dynamic
tracing, and will need updating to match any changes to this function.

Note that the flushes themselves are likely to originate from higher in the
I/O stack, such as from the file systems.

Since this uses BPF, only the root user can use this tool.
.SH REQUIREMENTS
CONFIG_BPF and bcc.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Trace md flush events:
#
.B mdflush
.SH FIELDS
.TP
TIME
Time of the flush event (HH:MM:SS).
.TP
PID
The process ID that was on-CPU when the event was issued. This may identify
the cause of the flush (eg, the "sync" command), but will often identify a
kernel worker thread that was managing I/O.
.TP
COMM
The command name for the PID.
.TP
DEVICE
The md device name.
.SH OVERHEAD
Expected to be negligible.
.SH SOURCE
This is from bcc.
