# cpuunclaimed   Sample CPU run queues and calculate unclaimed idle CPU.
#                For Linux, uses BCC, eBPF.
#
# This samples the length of the run queues and determine when there are idle
# CPUs, yet queued threads waiting their turn. Report the amount of idle
# (yet unclaimed by waiting threads) CPU as a system-wide percentage.
#
# This situation can happen for a number of reasons:
#
# - An application has been bound to some, but not all, CPUs, and has runnable
#   threads that cannot migrate to other CPUs due to this configuration.
# - CPU affinity: an optimization that leaves threads on CPUs where the CPU
#   caches are warm, even if this means short periods of waiting while other
#   CPUs are idle. The wait period is tunale (see sysctl, kernel.sched*).
# - Scheduler bugs.
#
# An unclaimed idle of < 1% is likely to be CPU affinity, and not usually a
# cause for concern. By leaving the CPU idle, overall throughput of the system
# may be improved. This tool is best for identifying larger issues, > 2%, due
# to the coarseness of its 99 Hertz samples.
#
# This is an experimental tool that currently works by use of sampling to
# keep overheads low. Tool assumptions:
#
# - CPU samples consistently fire around the same offset. There will sometimes
#   be a lag as a sample is delayed by higher-priority interrupts, but it is
#   assumed the subsequent samples will catch up to the expected offsets (as
#   is seen in practice). You can use -J to inspect sample offsets. Some
#   systems can power down CPUs when idle, and when they wake up again they
#   may begin firing at a skewed offset: this tool will detect the skew, print
#   an error, and exit.
# - All CPUs are online (see ncpu).
#
# If this identifies unclaimed CPU, you can double check it by dumping raw
# samples (-j), as well as using other tracing tools to instrument scheduler
# events (although this latter approach has much higher overhead).
#
# This tool passes all sampled events to user space for post processing.
# I originally wrote this to do the calculations entirerly in kernel context,
# and only pass a summary. That involves a number of challenges, and the
# overhead savings may not outweigh the caveats. You can see my WIP here:
# https://gist.github.com/brendangregg/731cf2ce54bf1f9a19d4ccd397625ad9
#
# USAGE: cpuunclaimed [-h] [-j] [-J] [-T] [interval] [count]
#
# If you see "Lost 1881 samples" warnings, try increasing wakeup_hz.
#
# REQUIRES: Linux 4.9+ (BPF_PROG_TYPE_PERF_EVENT support). Under tools/old is
# a version of this tool that may work on Linux 4.6 - 4.8.
