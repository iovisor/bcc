Demonstrations of tcpconnlat, the Linux eBPF/bcc version.


This tool traces the kernel function performing active TCP connections
(eg, via a connect() syscall), and shows the latency (time) for the connection
as measured locally: the time from SYN sent to the response packet.
For example:

# ./tcpconnlat
PID    COMM         IP SADDR            DADDR            DPORT LAT(ms)
1201   wget         4  10.153.223.157   23.23.100.231    80    1.65
1201   wget         4  10.153.223.157   23.23.100.231    443   1.60
1433   curl         4  10.153.223.157   104.20.25.153    80    0.75
1690   wget         4  10.153.223.157   66.220.156.68    80    1.10
1690   wget         4  10.153.223.157   66.220.156.68    443   0.95
1690   wget         4  10.153.223.157   66.220.156.68    443   0.99
2852   curl         4  10.153.223.157   23.101.17.61     80    250.86
[...]

The first line shows a connection from the "wget" process to the IPv4
destination address 23.23.100.231, port 80. This took 1.65 milliseconds: the
time from the SYN to the response.

TCP connection latency is a useful performance measure showing the time taken
to establish a connection. This typically involves kernel TCP/IP processing
and the network round trip time, and not application runtime.

tcpconnlat measures the time from any connection to the response packet, even
if the response is a RST (port closed).


USAGE message:

# ./tcpconnlat -h
usage: tcpconnlat [-h] [-t] [-p PID]

Trace TCP connects and show connection latency

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  -t, --timestamp    include timestamp on output
  -p PID, --pid PID  trace this PID only

examples:
    ./tcpconnlat           # trace all TCP connect()s
    ./tcpconnlat -t        # include timestamps
    ./tcpconnlat -p 181    # only trace PID 181
