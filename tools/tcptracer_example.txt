Demonstrations of tcptracer, the Linux eBPF/bcc version.


This tool traces the kernel function performing TCP connections (eg, via a
connect() or accept() syscalls) and closing them (explicitly or if the process
dies). Some example output (IP addresses are fake):

```
# ./tcptracer
Tracing TCP established connections. Ctrl-C to end.

```

This output shows three conections, one outgoing from a "telnet" process, one
outgoing from "curl" to a local netcat, and one incoming received by the "nc"
process. The output details show the kind of event (C for connection, X for
close and A for accept), PID, IP version, source address, destination address,
source port and destination port.
