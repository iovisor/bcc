Demonstrations of vfsrwcount

This counts how many bytes the vfs_read and vfs_write functions generate,
group the result by process and file, the output format is:
hour:minute:second
read:
[process_pid] [process_comm] [file_name] [count]
...
write:
[process_pid] [process_comm] [file_name] [count]

# ./vfsrwcount

read:
[12582] [fixdep] [swab.h] [550]
[12582] [fixdep] [scsi_proto.h] [10960]
...

When multiple programs generate IOs on multiple disks, this script
could help to find out that each program generates how many IOs on
each disk. It prints file name instead of full file path, because
getting full file path is an expensive operation, the file name should
provide enough hint about the IO is on which disk.
