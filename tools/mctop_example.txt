Demonstrations of mctop, the Linux eBPF/bcc version.


mctop summarizes and collects hotkeys insights from  memcached. Eg:


// FIXME


To try out mctop, a sample memcached instance with dtrace probes enabled
without semaphore support is available for testing via docker:


docker run --name memcached-dtrace -p 11211:11211/tcp quay.io/dalehamel/memcached-dtrace:latest


Alternatively, building memcached with --dtrace-enabled should allow for using
this feature in production.
