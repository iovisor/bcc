Demonstrations of filewriteback, the Linux eBPF/bcc version.

This program traces the writeback of cached files to disk.
The data are in folded stack format and can be used to generate the flamegraph.

How to run the script
Run ./filewriteback.py with root permissions.
The traced information will be stored in the "IOflamefiles" directory,
which contains three files, i.e., "IOflame.write.iops",
"IOflame.write.bandwidth", "IOflame.write.times".

How to interpret the result
Each line in the file contains the write information of the file path.
E.g., the information stored in "IOflame.write.iops" of the directory
"IOflamefiles" may be like this
"""
/;opt;log;tiger;tiger.log. 1
/;etc;system;agent;log;log 1
/;opt;log;tiger;dird 1
/;opt;log;tiger;dirc 1
/;opt;tiger;log;app;dira;dirb 1
"""
The first line means that the file path "/;opt;log;tiger;tiger.log." has "1"
iops.

How to generate the flamegraph
It's recommended to generate the flamegraph to visualize the result.
Using the command "./flamegraph.pl IOflame.write.iops > write_iops.svg",
we can get the flamegraph.

The meaning of the three files
(1)"IOflame.write.iops" is the write iops of the cached files to disk.
(2)"IOflame.write.bandwidth" is write bandwidth of the cached files to disk.
(3)"IOflame.write.times" is the write times of the cached files to disk.
