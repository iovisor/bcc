Demonstrations of trace.


trace probes functions you specify and displays trace messages if a particular
condition is met. You can control the message format to display function 
arguments and return values. 

For example, suppose you want to trace all commands being exec'd across the
system:

# trace 'sys_execve "%s", arg1'
PID    COMM         FUNC             -
4402   bash         sys_execve       /usr/bin/man
4411   man          sys_execve       /usr/local/bin/less
4411   man          sys_execve       /usr/bin/less
4410   man          sys_execve       /usr/local/bin/nroff
4410   man          sys_execve       /usr/bin/nroff
4409   man          sys_execve       /usr/local/bin/tbl
4409   man          sys_execve       /usr/bin/tbl
4408   man          sys_execve       /usr/local/bin/preconv
4408   man          sys_execve       /usr/bin/preconv
4415   nroff        sys_execve       /usr/bin/locale
4416   nroff        sys_execve       /usr/bin/groff
4418   groff        sys_execve       /usr/bin/grotty
4417   groff        sys_execve       /usr/bin/troff
^C

The ::sys_execve syntax specifies that you want an entry probe (which is the
default), in a kernel function (which is the default) called sys_execve. Next,
the format string to print is simply "%s", which prints a string. Finally, the
value to print is the first argument to the sys_execve function, which happens
to be the command that is exec'd. The above trace was generated by executing
"man ls" in a separate shell. As you see, man executes a number of additional
programs to finally display the man page.

Next, suppose you are looking for large reads across the system. Let's trace
the read system call and inspect the third argument, which is the number of
bytes to be read:

# trace 'sys_read (arg3 > 20000) "read %d bytes", arg3'
PID    COMM         FUNC             -
4490   dd           sys_read         read 1048576 bytes
4490   dd           sys_read         read 1048576 bytes
4490   dd           sys_read         read 1048576 bytes
4490   dd           sys_read         read 1048576 bytes
^C

During the trace, I executed "dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null bs=1M count=4".
The individual reads are visible, with the custom format message printed for
each read. The parenthesized expression "(arg3 > 20000)" is a filter that is
evaluated for each invocation of the probe before printing anything.

You can also trace user functions. For example, let's simulate the bashreadline
script, which attaches to the readline function in bash and prints its return
value, effectively snooping all bash shell input across the system:

# trace 'r:bash:readline "%s", retval'
PID    COMM         FUNC             -
2740   bash         readline         echo hi!
2740   bash         readline         man ls
^C

The special retval keywords stands for the function's return value, and can
be used only in a retprobe, specified by the 'r' prefix. The next component
of the probe is the library that contains the desired function. It's OK to
specify executables too, as long as they can be found in the PATH. Or, you
can specify the full path to the executable (e.g. "/usr/bin/bash").

Multiple probes can be combined on the same command line. For example, let's
trace failed read and write calls on the libc level, and include a time column:

# trace 'r:c:read ((int)retval < 0) "read failed: %d", retval' \
        'r:c:write ((int)retval < 0) "write failed: %d", retval' -T
TIME     PID    COMM         FUNC             -
05:31:57 3388   bash         write            write failed: -1
05:32:00 3388   bash         write            write failed: -1
^C

Note that the retval variable must be cast to int before comparing to zero.
The reason is that the default type for argN and retval is an unsigned 64-bit
integer, which can never be smaller than 0.

trace has also some basic support for kernel tracepoints. For example, let's
trace the block:block_rq_complete tracepoint and print out the number of sectors
transferred:

# trace 't:block:block_rq_complete "sectors=%d", args->nr_sector' -T
TIME     PID    COMM         FUNC             -
01:23:51 0      swapper/0    block_rq_complete sectors=8
01:23:55 10017  kworker/u64: block_rq_complete sectors=1
01:23:55 0      swapper/0    block_rq_complete sectors=8
^C

To discover the tracepoint structure format (which you can refer to as the "args"
pointer variable), use the tplist tool. For example:

# tplist -v block:block_rq_complete
block:block_rq_complete
    dev_t dev;
    sector_t sector;
    unsigned int nr_sector;
    int errors;
    char rwbs[8];

This output tells you that you can use "args->dev", "args->sector", etc. in your
predicate and trace arguments.


More and more high-level libraries are instrumented with USDT probe support.
These probes can be traced by trace just like kernel tracepoints. For example,
trace new threads being created and their function name:

# trace 'u:pthread:pthread_create "%U", arg3' -T
TIME     PID    COMM         FUNC             -
02:07:29 4051   contentions  pthread_create   primes_thread+0x0
02:07:29 4051   contentions  pthread_create   primes_thread+0x0
02:07:29 4051   contentions  pthread_create   primes_thread+0x0
02:07:29 4051   contentions  pthread_create   primes_thread+0x0
^C

The "%U" format specifier tells trace to resolve arg3 as a user-space symbol,
if possible. Similarly, use "%K" for kernel symbols.

Ruby, Node, and OpenJDK are also instrumented with USDT. For example, let's
trace Ruby methods being called (this requires a version of Ruby built with 
the --enable-dtrace configure flag):

# trace 'u:ruby:method__entry "%s.%s", arg1, arg2' -p $(pidof irb) -T
TIME     PID    COMM         FUNC             -
12:08:43 18420  irb          method__entry    IRB::Context.verbose?
12:08:43 18420  irb          method__entry    RubyLex.ungetc
12:08:43 18420  irb          method__entry    RuxyLex.debug?
^C

In the previous invocation, arg1 and arg2 are the class name and method name
for the Ruby method being invoked.


Occasionally, it can be useful to filter specific strings. For example, you
might be interested in open() calls that open a specific file:

# trace 'p:c:open (STRCMP("test.txt", arg1)) "opening %s", arg1' -T
TIME     PID    COMM         FUNC             -
01:43:15 10938  cat          open             opening test.txt
01:43:20 10939  cat          open             opening test.txt
^C


In the preceding example, as well as in many others, readability may be
improved by providing the function's signature, which names the arguments and
lets you access structure sub-fields, which is hard with the "arg1", "arg2"
convention. For example:

# trace 'p:c:open(char *filename) "opening %s", filename'
PID    TID    COMM         FUNC             -
17507  17507  cat          open             opening FAQ.txt
^C

# trace 'p::SyS_nanosleep(struct timespec *ts) "sleep for %lld ns", ts->tv_nsec'
PID    TID    COMM         FUNC             -
777    785    automount    SyS_nanosleep    sleep for 500000000 ns
777    785    automount    SyS_nanosleep    sleep for 500000000 ns
777    785    automount    SyS_nanosleep    sleep for 500000000 ns
777    785    automount    SyS_nanosleep    sleep for 500000000 ns
^C


As a final example, let's trace open syscalls for a specific process. By 
default, tracing is system-wide, but the -p switch overrides this:

# trace -p 2740 'do_sys_open "%s", arg2' -T
TIME     PID    COMM         FUNC             -
05:36:16 15872  ls           do_sys_open      /etc/ld.so.cache
05:36:16 15872  ls           do_sys_open      /lib64/libselinux.so.1
05:36:16 15872  ls           do_sys_open      /lib64/libcap.so.2
05:36:16 15872  ls           do_sys_open      /lib64/libacl.so.1
05:36:16 15872  ls           do_sys_open      /lib64/libc.so.6
05:36:16 15872  ls           do_sys_open      /lib64/libpcre.so.1
05:36:16 15872  ls           do_sys_open      /lib64/libdl.so.2
05:36:16 15872  ls           do_sys_open      /lib64/libattr.so.1
05:36:16 15872  ls           do_sys_open      /lib64/libpthread.so.0
05:36:16 15872  ls           do_sys_open      /usr/lib/locale/locale-archive
05:36:16 15872  ls           do_sys_open      /home/vagrant
^C

In this example, we traced the "ls ~" command as it was opening its shared
libraries and then accessing the /home/vagrant directory listing.
