Demonstrations of trace.


trace probes functions you specify and displays trace messages if a particular
condition is met. You can control the message format to display function 
arguments and return values. 

For example, suppose you want to trace all commands being exec'd across the
system:

# trace '::sys_execve "%s", arg1'
TIME     PID    COMM         FUNC             -
05:11:51 4402   bash         sys_execve       /usr/bin/man
05:11:51 4411   man          sys_execve       /usr/local/bin/less
05:11:51 4411   man          sys_execve       /usr/bin/less
05:11:51 4410   man          sys_execve       /usr/local/bin/nroff
05:11:51 4410   man          sys_execve       /usr/bin/nroff
05:11:51 4409   man          sys_execve       /usr/local/bin/tbl
05:11:51 4409   man          sys_execve       /usr/bin/tbl
05:11:51 4408   man          sys_execve       /usr/local/bin/preconv
05:11:51 4408   man          sys_execve       /usr/bin/preconv
05:11:51 4415   nroff        sys_execve       /usr/bin/locale
05:11:51 4416   nroff        sys_execve       /usr/bin/groff
05:11:51 4418   groff        sys_execve       /usr/bin/grotty
05:11:51 4417   groff        sys_execve       /usr/bin/troff
^C

The ::sys_execve syntax specifies that you want an entry probe (which is the
default), in a kernel function (which is the default) called sys_execve. Next,
the format string to print is simply "%s", which prints a string. Finally, the
value to print is the first argument to the sys_execve function, which happens
to be the command that is exec'd. The above trace was generated by executing
"man ls" in a separate shell. As you see, man executes a number of additional
programs to finally display the man page.

Next, suppose you are looking for large reads across the system. Let's trace
the read system call and inspect the third argument, which is the number of
bytes to be read:

# trace '::sys_read (arg3 > 20000) "read %d bytes", arg3'
TIME     PID    COMM         FUNC             -
05:18:23 4490   dd           sys_read         read 1048576 bytes
05:18:23 4490   dd           sys_read         read 1048576 bytes
05:18:23 4490   dd           sys_read         read 1048576 bytes
05:18:23 4490   dd           sys_read         read 1048576 bytes
^C

During the trace, I executed "dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null bs=1M count=4".
The individual reads are visible, with the custom format message printed for
each read. The parenthesized expression "(arg3 > 20000)" is a filter that is
evaluated for each invocation of the probe before printing anything.

You can also trace user functions. For example, let's simulate the bashreadline
script, which attaches to the readline function in bash and prints its return
value, effectively snooping all bash shell input across the system:

# trace 'r:bash:readline "%s", retval'
TIME     PID    COMM         FUNC             -
05:24:50 2740   bash         readline         echo hi!
05:24:53 2740   bash         readline         man ls
^C

The special retval keywords stands for the function's return value, and can
be used only in a retprobe, specified by the 'r' prefix. The next component
of the probe is the library that contains the desired function. It's OK to
specify executables too, as long as they can be found in the PATH. Or, you
can specify the full path to the executable (e.g. "/usr/bin/bash").

Multiple probes can be combined on the same command line. For example, let's
trace failed read and write calls on the libc level:

# trace 'r:c:read ((int)retval < 0) "read failed: %d", retval' \
        'r:c:write ((int)retval < 0) "write failed: %d", retval'
TIME     PID    COMM         FUNC             -
05:31:57 3388   bash         write            write failed: -1
05:32:00 3388   bash         write            write failed: -1
^C

Note that the retval variable must be cast to int before comparing to zero.
The reason is that the default type for argN and retval is an unsigned 64-bit
integer, which can never be smaller than 0.

As a final example, let's trace open syscalls for a specific process. By 
default, tracing is system-wide, but the -p switch overrides this:

# trace -p 2740 '::do_sys_open "%s", arg2'
TIME     PID    COMM         FUNC             -
05:36:16 15872  ls           do_sys_open      /etc/ld.so.cache
05:36:16 15872  ls           do_sys_open      /lib64/libselinux.so.1
05:36:16 15872  ls           do_sys_open      /lib64/libcap.so.2
05:36:16 15872  ls           do_sys_open      /lib64/libacl.so.1
05:36:16 15872  ls           do_sys_open      /lib64/libc.so.6
05:36:16 15872  ls           do_sys_open      /lib64/libpcre.so.1
05:36:16 15872  ls           do_sys_open      /lib64/libdl.so.2
05:36:16 15872  ls           do_sys_open      /lib64/libattr.so.1
05:36:16 15872  ls           do_sys_open      /lib64/libpthread.so.0
05:36:16 15872  ls           do_sys_open      /usr/lib/locale/locale-archive
05:36:16 15872  ls           do_sys_open      /home/vagrant
^C

In this example, we traced the "ls ~" command as it was opening its shared
libraries and then accessing the /home/vagrant directory listing.
