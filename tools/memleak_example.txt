Demonstrations of memleak.


memleak traces and matches memory allocation and deallocation requests, and
collects call stacks for each allocation. memleak can then print a summary
of which call stacks performed allocations that weren't subsequently freed.
For example:

# ./memleak -p $(pidof allocs)
Attaching to malloc and free in pid 5193, Ctrl+C to quit.

        80 bytes in 5 allocations from stack
                 main+0x6d [/home/vagrant/allocs] (400862) 
                 __libc_start_main+0xf0 [/usr/lib64/libc-2.21.so] (7fd460ac2790)

Each entry printed is a set of allocations that originate from the same call
stack, and that weren't freed yet. The number of bytes and number of allocs
are followed by the call stack, top to bottom, of the allocation site.

As time goes on, it becomes apparent that the main function in the allocs
process is leaking memory, 16 bytes at a time. Fortunately, you don't have to
inspect each allocation individually -- you get a nice summary of which stack
is responsible for a large leak.

Occasionally, you do want the individual allocation details. Perhaps the same
stack is allocating various sizes and you want to confirm which sizes are 
prevalent. Use the -a switch:

# ./memleak -p $(pidof allocs) -a
Attaching to malloc and free in pid 5193, Ctrl+C to quit.

When using the -p switch, memleak traces the allocations of a particular
process. Without this switch, kernel allocations (kmalloc) are traced instead.
For example:

# ./memleak
Attaching to kmalloc and kfree, Ctrl+C to quit.

Here you can see that arming the kprobe to which our eBPF program is attached
consumed 8KB of memory. Loading the BPF program also consumed a couple hundred
bytes (in bpf_prog_load).

memleak stores each allocated block along with its size, timestamp, and the
stack that allocated it. When the block is deleted, this information is freed
to reduce the memory overhead.

To avoid false positives, allocations younger than a certain age (500ms by
default) are not printed. To change this threshold, use the -o switch.

By default, memleak prints its output every 5 seconds. To change this 
interval, pass the interval as a positional parameter to memleak. You can 
also control the number of times the output will be printed before exiting.
For example:

# ./memleak 1 10

... will print the outstanding allocation statistics every second, for ten
times, and then exit. 

memleak may introduce considerable overhead if your application or kernel is
allocating and freeing memory at a very high rate. In that case, you can 
control the overhead by sampling every N-th allocation. For example, to sample
roughly 10% of the allocations and print the outstanding allocations every 5
seconds, 3 times before quitting:

# ./memleak -p $(pidof allocs) -s 10 5 3
Attaching to malloc and free in pid 2614, Ctrl+C to quit.
[11:16:33] Top 2 stacks with outstanding allocations:

[11:16:38] Top 2 stacks with outstanding allocations:
        16 bytes in 1 allocations from stack
                 main+0x6d [/home/vagrant/allocs] (400862) 
                 __libc_start_main+0xf0 [/usr/lib64/libc-2.21.so] (7fdc11ce8790) 

[11:16:43] Top 2 stacks with outstanding allocations:
        32 bytes in 2 allocations from stack
                 main+0x6d [/home/vagrant/allocs] (400862) 
                 __libc_start_main+0xf0 [/usr/lib64/libc-2.21.so] (7fdc11ce8790) 

Note that even though the application leaks 16 bytes of memory every second, 
the report (printed every 5 seconds) doesn't "see" all the allocations because
of the sampling rate applied.
