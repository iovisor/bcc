Demonstartion of scheduler_decison_latency

scheduler latency is the amount of time a task waits on a cpu before it
actually gets a chance to run.

scheduler decision latency is the time taken by the cpu in deciding the
processor on which the task needs to be wokenup.

Usage: scheduler_decision_latency.py [-h] [-c COMM]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c COMM, --comm COMM  Collects stats only for the comm specified
